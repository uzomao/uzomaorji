                                        Uzoma Orji is a creative technologist and visual artist from Owerri, Nigeria.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As a technologist he seeks to design engaging human-centred digital experiences that bring the arts and 
                                        tech into the same conversation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As an artist he observes and then creates representations of society and of history; visual metaphors that explain
                                        his millennial Igbo Nigerian cultural context and the cultural environment he hopes to one day live in.

                                        The essence of his practice is indeed identity, particularly as pertains to self, culture, and nationality. 
                                        His work uses his notions of his identity as a point of exit to interrogate who we are, 
                                        how we have come to be and who we aspire to become.
