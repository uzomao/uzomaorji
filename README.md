##  Notes to self

1. Run with `npm run develop` so that environment variables are loaded.

2. Project is deployed at <a href='https://app.netlify.com/sites/uzoma/'>https://app.netlify.com/sites/uzoma/</a>. Currently there are two deploy branches - `master` and `staging`. Additional deploy branches can be created as and when needed in Netlify. New commits to both branches are setup to deploy automatically, the current workflow is to push to `staging` and merge with `master` after testing.
